## Masters Project - Ecosystem Collapse
This is my Masters Project from a couple of years back. I analysed the development of vegetative stripes to understand how some ecosystems revert to a desert with limited amounts of rain. I demonstrated that most ecosystems are actually very robust to a change in the system.

I am translating my (rather messy) MATLAB code into a more succinct Python code. I wrote it across many files including finding the steady states, integrating the system using finite differences and bifurcation analysis.
